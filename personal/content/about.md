Hey.

I'm not super great with writing about myself, it aways feels weird.

So, who am I?

---

## basics.

As of my writing of this, I'm 30 years old and living in the Greater Boston Area.

---

## professional.

I'm currently a Associate Infrastructure Engineer with [Hachette Book Group](http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/)

My main focus there is our server infrastructure, but I also dabble a little bit with our storage. My boss wants me to touch more networking stuff, but if I didn't have to touch
cisco gear, I wouldn't be upset.

These days I'm most interested in the things happening in the DevOps/SRE space.



---

## personal.

Outside of work, I'm an avid musician and tabletop gamer.

Currently, I'm in Kreisau Circle doing vocals.

Past work I've done is here:
