Hey. <br />
I'm not super great with writing about myself, it aways feels weird. <br />
So, who am I?

---

## basics.

As of my writing of this, I'm 31 years old and living in the Greater Boston Area.

---

## professional.

I'm currently a DevOps Engineer with [Mobile Heartbeat](http://www.mobileheartbeat.com/), formally Infrastucture Engineer at [Hachette Book Group](www.hachettebookgroup.com),
formally formally IT Specialist III at [State of Vermont](www.vermont.gov) <br />
I'm just figuring this out. My main tasks will be automating our software deployments to client sites. I'll update this when I get a roadmap in place. <br />
These days, professionally, I'm most interested in the things happening in the DevOps/SRE space.

---

## personal.

Outside of work, I'm an avid musician and tabletop gamer.

Currently music-wise, I'm in Kreisau Circle doing vocals. <br />
Past work I've done is here:<br />
https://doomservice.bandcamp.com/ <br />
https://hunger.bandcamp.com
