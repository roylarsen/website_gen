# I've got a new job!

So, as of 20171009, I'm in my last week of work at Hachette Book Group. Next week I start my new role as DevOps Engineer at Mobile Heartbeat!

I'm an equal mix of excited, scared, and a little bummed.

* Excited because this is something I've been woring towards for a couple years now (the huge pay bump doesn't hurt)
* Scared because it'll be one of my first more *senior* roles I've had
* Bummed because I'm leaving Downtown Boston and I'll be leaving my friends at HBG

This job will be a great platform to really start developing my skills in the DevOps space. I'm stoked
to work with some amazing people to build and deliver a (tbh) awesome tool in the healthcare space.
